# Daily Dictionary

## Train Your Brain

Our app helps users train by learning new words everyday. This will help cognitive development and offset Alzheimer's.

## Challenges

We faced a few obstacles along the way of the project. We had one member who had to drop the course and so we had some difficulty with github. We had many other issues with github along the way which we were able to resolve with the instructor and TA.

Another issue we faced was multiple things breaking everytime we approved pull requests. We were as a team able to resolve these issues however.

## Next Steps

In the future perhaps we could make an interactive app for mobile phones. We could also experiement with adding things like puzzles, sudoku to help stimulate the user's brain.
